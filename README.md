# Arabic-Dialect-classification
A task to Build arabic dialect with machine learning and deep learning classifiers using Twitter data, and show that a simple classifier can predict dialect quite effectively.

# Dataset
w


# Cleaning data:
- Using regex to filter out emojis, punctuation, non-arabic chars, and normalize a special arabic characters.
- Save cleaned data into a seperate dataframe.



# Machine learning classifiers
## Classifiers:
- SGD Classifier
- Multinomial
- Linear SVC
## Results:
- Perform confusion matrix, classification report.

# Deep Learning - Text Classification with LSTM
- Word2Vec
- Word embeddings using Gensim
## Results:
- Perform plots and prediction test on test data.
